# {{ model_name }} Model Card

Model2Vec distills a Sentence Transformer into a small, static model.
This model is ideal for applications requiring fast, lightweight embeddings.



## Installation

Install model2vec using pip:
```
pip install model2vec
```

## Usage
Load this model using the `from_pretrained` method:
```python
from model2vec import StaticModel

# Load a pretrained Model2Vec model
model = StaticModel.from_pretrained("{{ model_name }}")

# Compute text embeddings
embeddings = model.encode(["Example sentence"])
```

## How it works

Model2vec creates a small, fast, and powerful model that outperforms other static embedding models by a large margin on all tasks we could find, while being much faster to create than traditional static embedding models such as GloVe. Best of all, you don't need any data to distill a model using Model2Vec.

It works by passing a vocabulary through a sentence transformer model, then reducing the dimensionality of the resulting embeddings using PCA, and finally weighting the embeddings using zipf weighting. During inference, we simply take the mean of all token embeddings occurring in a sentence.
