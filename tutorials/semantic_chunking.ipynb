    "Semantic chunking is a task of identifying the semantic boundaries of a piece of text. In this tutorial, we will use the [Chonkie](https://github.com/bhavnicksm/chonkie) library to perform semantic chunking on the book War and Peace. Chonkie is a library that provides a lightweight and fast solution to semantic chunking using pre-trained models. It supports our [potion models](https://huggingface.co/collections/minishlab/potion-6721e0abd4ea41881417f062) out of the box, which we will be using in this tutorial.\n",

He took  out a notebook, hurriedly scribbled something in pencil, tore out the  leaf, gave it to Kozlóvski, stepped quickly to the window, and threw  himself into a chair, gazing at those in the room as if asking, “Why  do they look at me? ” Then he lifted his head, stretched his neck as  if he intended to say something, but immediately, with affected  indifference, began to hum to himself, producing a queer sound which  immediately broke off. \n",

      " “I like your being businesslike about  it. ”    And patting Berg on the shoulder he got up, wishing to end the  conversation. But Berg, smiling pleasantly, explained that if he did not  know for certain how much Véra would have and did not receive at least  part of the dowry in advance, he would have to break matters off. “Because, consider, Count—if I allowed myself to marry now  without having definite means to maintain my wife, I should be acting  badly. ”    The conversation ended by the count, who wished to be generous and to  avoid further importunity, saying that he would give a note of hand  for eighty thousand rubles. Berg smiled meekly, kissed the count on the  shoulder, and said that he was very grateful, but that it was impossible  for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in  ready money. “Or at least twenty thousand, Count,” he added, “and  then a note of hand for only sixty thousand. ”    “Yes, yes, all right! ” said the count hurriedly. “Only excuse me,  my dear fellow, I’ll give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for  eighty thousand as well. ”            CHAPTER XII    Natásha was sixteen and it was the year 1809, the very year to which  she had counted on her fingers with Borís after they had kissed four  years ago. Since then she had not seen him. Before Sónya and her  mother, if Borís happened to be mentioned, she spoke quite freely of  that episode as of some childish, long-forgotten matter that was not  worth mentioning. But in the secret depths of her soul the question  whether her engagement to Borís was a jest or an important, binding  promise tormented her. \n",

      " Borís came to the Rostóvs’ box, received their congratulations very  simply, and raising his eyebrows with an absent-minded smile conveyed to  Natásha and Sónya his fiancée’s invitation to her wedding, and  went away. Natásha with a gay, coquettish smile talked to him, and  congratulated on his approaching wedding that same Borís with whom  she had formerly been in love. In the state of intoxication she was in,  everything seemed simple and natural. The scantily clad Hélène smiled at everyone in the same way, and  Natásha gave Borís a similar smile. \n",
