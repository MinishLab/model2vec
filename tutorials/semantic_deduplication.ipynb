    "**Semantic Deduplication with Model2Vec**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we’ll explore how Model2Vec can help identify duplicates in text data that traditional exact matching would miss. While exact matching works for identical texts, it fails to detect near-duplicates—documents that may differ slightly in wording but convey the same meaning. Using Model2Vec, we embed documents into vectors and measure their similarity. This allows us to catch both exact and semantic duplicates, improving the quality of our dataset. With Model2Vec’s speed and efficiency, we can very efficiently perform deduplication on large datasets, ensuring cleaner, more robust data for downstream tasks. We can also use Model2Vec to detect train-test overlap, ensuring that our models are not overfitting to the training data."
