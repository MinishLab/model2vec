Model2Vec is a technique to turn any sentence transformer into a really small static model, reducing model size by 15x and making the models up to 500x faster, with a small drop in performance. Our [best model](https://huggingface.co/minishlab/potion-base-32M) is the most performant static embedding model in the world. See our results [here](results/README.md), or dive in to see how it works.


## Updates & Announcements

- **12/02/2024**: We released **Model2Vec training**, allowing you to fine-tune your own classification models on top of Model2Vec models. Find out more in our [documentation](https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec/blob/main/model2vec/train/README.md) and in our [blog post](LINK).

- **30/01/2024**: We released two new models: [potion-base-32M](https://huggingface.co/minishlab/potion-base-32M) and [potion-retrieval-32M](https://huggingface.co/minishlab/potion-retrieval-32M). [potion-base-32M](https://huggingface.co/minishlab/potion-base-32M) is our most performant model to date, using a larger vocabulary and higher dimensions. [potion-retrieval-32M](https://huggingface.co/minishlab/potion-retrieval-32M) is a finetune of [potion-base-32M](https://huggingface.co/minishlab/potion-base-32M) that is optimized for retrieval tasks, and is the best performing static retrieval model currently available.

- **30/10/2024**: We released three new models: [potion-base-8M](https://huggingface.co/minishlab/potion-base-8M), [potion-base-4M](https://huggingface.co/minishlab/potion-base-4M), and [potion-base-2M](https://huggingface.co/minishlab/potion-base-2M). These models are trained using [Tokenlearn](https://github.com/MinishLab/tokenlearn). Find out more in our [blog post](https://minishlab.github.io/tokenlearn_blogpost/). NOTE: for users of any of our old English M2V models, we recommend switching to these new models as they [perform better on all tasks](https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec/tree/main/results).

## Quickstart

Install the package with:

```bash
pip install model2vec
```

This will install the base inference package, which only depends on `numpy` and a few other minor dependencies. If you want to distill your own models, you can install the distillation extras with:

```bash
pip install model2vec[distill]
```

The easiest way to get started with Model2Vec is to load one of our [flagship models from the HuggingFace hub](https://huggingface.co/collections/minishlab/potion-6721e0abd4ea41881417f062). These models are pre-trained and ready to use. The following code snippet shows how to load a model and make embeddings:
```python
from model2vec import StaticModel

# Load a model from the HuggingFace hub (in this case the potion-base-8M model)
model = StaticModel.from_pretrained("minishlab/potion-base-8M")

# Make embeddings
embeddings = model.encode(["It's dangerous to go alone!", "It's a secret to everybody."])

# Make sequences of token embeddings
token_embeddings = model.encode_as_sequence(["It's dangerous to go alone!", "It's a secret to everybody."])
```

And that's it. You can use the model to classify texts, to cluster, or to build a RAG system.

Instead of using one of our models, you can also distill your own Model2Vec model from a Sentence Transformer model. The following code snippet shows how to distill a model:
```python
from model2vec.distill import distill

# Distill a Sentence Transformer model, in this case the BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 model
m2v_model = distill(model_name="BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5", pca_dims=256)

# Save the model
m2v_model.save_pretrained("m2v_model")
```

Distillation is really fast and only takes 30 seconds on CPU. Best of all, distillation requires no training data.

For advanced usage, such as using Model2Vec in the [Sentence Transformers library](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers), please refer to the [Usage](#usage) sections.


## Main Features

- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Model2Vec models outperform any other static embeddings (such as GLoVe and BPEmb) by a large margin, as can be seen in our [results](results/README.md).
- **Small**: Model2Vec reduces the size of a Sentence Transformer model by a factor of 15, from 120M params, down to 7.5M (30 MB on disk, making it the smallest model on [MTEB](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard)!).
- **Lightweight Dependencies**: the base package's only major dependency is `numpy`.
- **Lightning-fast Inference**: up to 500 times faster on CPU than the original model. Go green or go home.
- **Fast, Dataset-free Distillation**: distill your own model in 30 seconds on a CPU, without a dataset. All you need is a model and (optionally) a custom vocabulary.
- **Integrated in many popular libraries**: Model2Vec can be used directly in popular libraries such as [Sentence Transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers), [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain), [txtai](https://github.com/neuml/txtai), and [Chonkie](https://github.com/bhavnicksm/chonkie). See the [Integrations](#integrations) section for more information.
- **Tightly integrated with HuggingFace hub**: easily share and load models from the HuggingFace hub, using the familiar `from_pretrained` and `push_to_hub`. Our own models can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/minishlab).

## What is Model2Vec?

Model2vec creates a small, fast, and powerful model that outperforms other static embedding models by a large margin on all tasks we could find, while being much faster to create than traditional static embedding models such as GloVe. Like BPEmb, it can create subword embeddings, but with much better performance. Distillation doesn't need _any_ data, just a vocabulary and a model.

The core idea is to forward pass a vocabulary through a sentence transformer model, creating static embeddings for the indiviudal tokens. After this, there are a number of post-processing steps we do that results in our best models. For a more extensive deepdive, please refer to the following resources:
- Our initial [Model2Vec blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/Pringled/model2vec). Note that, while this post gives a good overview of the core idea, we've made a number of substantial improvements since then.
- Our [Tokenlearn blog post](https://minishlab.github.io/tokenlearn_blogpost/). This post describes the Tokenlearn method we used to train our [potion models](https://huggingface.co/collections/minishlab/potion-6721e0abd4ea41881417f062).
- Our official [documentation](https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec/blob/main/docs/what_is_model2vec.md). This document provides a high-level overview of how Model2Vec works.
